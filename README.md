# BinPackingSolver
This project implements a Bin Packing Solver using MIPS Assembly Language. It allows users to upload a file containing space-separated float values (representing item sizes between 0.0 and 1.0), choose a bin-packing heuristic First-Fit (FF) or Best-Fit (BF) and view the bin allocation results in an output file.
